# Ionic 2 Webpack Starter

Ionic 2 starter project using Webpack 2 and [@ngtools/webpack](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/webpack) for AoT template compilation.

Includes Sass support to customise the Ionic theme. Does not (yet) include integration with Cordova.

To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
* Run `npm run build` to bundle everything into the `dist` folder for deployment.
* Run `npm run build:prod` to do the same as above but enabling optimisations for production.
